# To-Do List

A simple to-do list I made while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I’m using it to keep track of my own tasks and (hopefully) avoid procrastinating.  
It also saves everything in the browser using local storage, so my tasks stay even after refreshing or closing the page.

## Live Demo

5. Your tasks will still be there next time you open the page.
